Stealth Mode Project

I got an idea regarding the delivery.
We will use queues and tokens like restaurants and will have particular delivery spots in those regions from where 
the people will have to come and take the copies. Whenever their order will be ready, we will give them a notification
in the app. and they will come and take it. 

Payment will be online and cash on delivery will only be done for loose sheets.
